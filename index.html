	<h1> HOLD UP ! <h1>
	<p> The website is not ready yet!, please come back when you become mmmmh, richer! <p>
	<p> Jokes aside this website is not ready yet, i (Midou) still am not motivated to code in react.js as i still don't see the point of that (don't blame me) <p>
	<h3> however! <h3>
	<p> i will make a temporary website in html then rewrite it in React.js! Just so the website doesn't feel so dead \(.-.)/ <p>
	<h6> ps: more css will come later so have fun with this ugly 90-ish website page<h6>
